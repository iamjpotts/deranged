# Deny-by-default lints: These are lints that indicate a lack of compiler guarantees, future
# incompatibility (with no guarantees in the meantime) introduce surprising behavior, or are likely
# to cause undesired behavior. Code that trigger these lints should only be allowed with a
# compelling reason that is clearly documented.

# Warn-by-default lints: These are lints that indicate possible errors, future incompatibility
# (with guaranteed behavior in the meantime), or other stylistic issues (including idioms). Code
# that trigger these lints should not cause undesired behavior and may be allowed as necessary.

# All overrides need higher priority. Any overrides that are for a specific crate need to be done
# the "traditional" way of using attributes at the crate root.
